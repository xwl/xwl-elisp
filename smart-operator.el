;;; Commentary:

;; This extension tries to insert operators with surrounding spaces smartly.
;; e.g., `=' becomes ` = ', `+=' becomes ` += '.  This is handy for writing
;; C-style sources.

;; To use, put this file to your load-path and the following to your
;; ~/.emacs:
;;             (require 'smart-operator)
;;
;; Then `M-x smart-operator-mode' for toggling this minor mode.

;;; Acknowledgements

;; Nikolaj Schumacher <n_schumacher@web.de>, for suggesting
;; reimplementing as a minor mode and providing an initial patch for
;; that.

;;; Code:

(require 'cc-mode)

;;; smart-operator minor mode
